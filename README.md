LSP
===
The (unofficial) LUSAS Scripting Pack

The LSP contains over 35 useful (and not so useful) scripts developed, over time, to help enhance the LUSAS experience.

Remember that these scripts can make permenant changes to the model, so save a copy, read the code, understand what will happen and _then_ run it.

A full list of the scripts, along with a brief description of what they do, can be found in the [menu definition file](https://github.com/thomasmichaelwallace/LSP/blob/master/LSP%20-%20Menu.txt "Definition").

Installing
----------

To install download the latest version of the [setup script (LSP - Install.vbs)](https://raw.github.com/thomasmichaelwallace/LSP/master/LSP%20-%20Install.vbs "Setup"), and run it within LUSAS [File > Script > Run Script].

Once installed the LSP scripts can be accessed from the new LSP menu. The LSP can also be updated from this menu.

Note: While the LPI does not tend to change significantly between minor versions, the LSP is currently only tested on 14.7.

Author and Licence
----------

The LSP is primiarly written by Thomas Michael Wallace (www.thomasmichaelwallace.co.uk), and released under the GPL v3 licence.

It should go without saying, but the LSP is not endorsed by [LUSAS](http://www.LUSAS.com "LUSAS")
